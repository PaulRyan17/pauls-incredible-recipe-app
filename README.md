You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Picture this: 

You've invited your tech-savvy friends over for a dinner extravaganza, only to discover that the grocery store has mysteriously vanished into thin air! Panic not, for you're a React wizard with a brilliant plan. Your backend magician friend promises to craft a magical RESTful API that'll conjure up recipes with just a few incantations: ingredients, quantities, cooking time, ingredient count, and meal type.
